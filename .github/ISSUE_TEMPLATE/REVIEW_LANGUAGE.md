## Review LANGUAGE Translations for Python

In order to review this language to the project, complete the steps detailed in the [translation guide](https://docs.legesher.io/legesher-translations/translation-guide) (from Step #6 onward). We are primarily working developing Legesher for the Python programming language. In the future we hope to add more programming languages in the future.

**Reviewing** a translation is extremely important as we want to best understand the culture and context behind the words we select as keywords for the programming languages. The more perspectives the better! üëÄPlease take your time in being thorough with these translations. Think back when you were learning how to program and how context of words help you bridge together meaning and functionality.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: this issue is to review the Python keywords and builtin functions only. Any additional translation reviews are encouraged, but not necessary.

**To complete this issue**:

- [ ] Update any content in this issue from `LANGUAGE` to the name of the language. (Romanian, Arabic, Welsh etc.)
- [ ] Title this issue "Review Language: LANGUAGE (Python)"
- [ ] Update the Python section of the LANGUAGE's `locale/__.yml` file (files are named using the language abbreviation) by adding comments as followed.

  - **Agreeable:** Leave a `# @username ‚úÖ_with any additional commentary afterwards_` after a translation if you agree that the right word to give context to the keyword is the one initially translated.
  - **Optimistic:** Leave a `# @username ‚ùì_with any additional commentary afterwards_` after a translation if you think there may be a better translation / form of the translation
  - **Unsure:** Leave a `# @username ü§î_with any additional commentary afterwards_` after a word that you're not sure if there is a translation

  This issue will be complete when all the words for a programming language looks something like this:

  ```yml
  int: "initiatorsTranslation" # ‚úÖ @firstreviewer, ‚ùì@secondreviewer what about this otherTranslation, ‚ùì@thirdreviewer I agree with otherTranslation, ‚úÖ @fourthreviewer, ‚úÖ @fifthreviewer I also think otherTranslation would be a good option
  ```

- [ ] Merge changes into branch titled `LANGUAGE-translation` on this repo, **NOT** the `master` branch. Please reference this issue in the pull request.

### Reviewers Needed

In order to add the translations for official use across Legesher, the translations will need to be approved and accepted by **5 additional native / fluent speakers**. If you would like to be one of the reviewers for this language, please mention in this issue! :smile: Also feel free to loop in a friend that might be able to help with the translations! Please refer to the [translation guide](https://docs.legesher.io/legesher-translations/translation-guide) for the next step in the review process.
